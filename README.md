# Stock-Price-Forcasting
Project involves predicting the future prices of stocks using historical data. This project can be implemented using various machine learning techniques such as time series analysis, regression models, and even deep learning models like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks).

Concepts:
Stock Analysis: The difference between fundamental and technical analysis was well-explained, setting the context for why the focus is on technical analysis for short-term predictions.

Time-Series Data: The explanation of stock prices as time-series data is crucial for understanding why techniques like Moving Averages and LSTMs are appropriate.

Moving Averages: The implementation and comparison between Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) show how these techniques smooth out fluctuations and why EMA might be preferred in certain contexts due to its responsiveness to recent data.

LSTM for Stock Prediction: The LSTM model, with its ability to capture long-term dependencies in data, is presented as a more advanced method for predicting stock prices. The step-by-step guide on building, training, and evaluating the LSTM model makes it accessible even to readers who might be new to deep learning.

Evaluation Metrics: Using RMSE and MAPE as metrics provides a clear, quantitative way to compare the performance of different models.
